# Test plan

## 1.	Introduction
### 1.1	Purpose
The purpose of the Iteration Test Plan is to gather all of the information necessary to plan and control the test effort for a given iteration. 
It describes the approach to testing the software.
This Test Plan for Mix-It supports the following objectives:
-	Identifies the items that should be targeted by the tests.
-	Identifies the motivation for and ideas behind the test areas to be covered.
-	Outlines the testing approach that will be used.
-	Identifies the required resources and provides an estimate of the test efforts.

### 1.2	Scope
This document describes the used tests, as they are unittests and functionality testing.

### 1.3	Intended Audience
This document is meant for internal use primarily.

## 2.	Evaluation Mission and Test Motivation
### 2.1	Background
By testing our project, we make sure that all changes to the sourcecode do not break the functionality. Also by integrating the test process in our deployment process, we make sure that only working versions of our project getting deployed. So the web application is always available.
### 2.2	Evaluation Mission
Our motivation in implementing tests came at an early stage to recognize the need for errors and to ensure the functionality and thus the outstanding quality of the software.
### 2.3	Test Motivators
Our testing is motivated by 
- quality risks 
- technical risks, 
- use cases 
- functional requirements

## 3.	Target Test Items
The listing below identifies those test items (software, hardware, and supporting product elements) that have been identified as targets for testing. This list represents what items will be tested. 

Items for Testing:
- Laravel (PHP) backend
- web frontend
- database operations

### 5.2	Testing Techniques and Types
#### 5.2.1	Database Integrity Testing
|| |
|---|---|
|Technique Objective  	| Exercise database access and observe behaviour |
|Technique 		|  Execute queries and observe desired results with other queries |
|Oracles 		|  Queries will store and delete data and it will be represented in the database   |
|Required Tools 	| PHPUnit	 |
|Success Criteria	|    Green tests         |
|Special Considerations	|     -          |

#### 5.2.2 Function Testing
|| |
|---|---|
|Technique Objective  	| Test navigation, data entry, processing, and retrieval. Observe and log target behavior. |
|Technique 		|  PHPUnit tests that simulate different values  |
|Oracles 		|  user enter valid data, for example a valid username and a valid password   |
|Required Tools 	| Selenium + Cucumber	 |
|Success Criteria	|    successful senarios         |
|Special Considerations	|     -          |

#### 5.2.3 Business Cycle Testing
n/a

#### 5.2.4 User Interface Testing
|| |
|---|---|
|Technique Objective  	| Navigate though the web-page to reflect production scenarios including button clicks, navigation and keys. Window objects and characteristics can be exercisedâ€“such as menus, size, position, state, and focus. |
|Technique 		|  Execute each use-case functions and features, using valid and invalid data, to verify the expected results or errors and warning messages|
|Oracles 		|  user enter valid data, for example a valid username and a valid password   |
|Required Tools 	| Selenium + Cucumber	 |
|Success Criteria	|    successful senarios         |
|Special Considerations	|     -          |

## 6.	Entry and Exit Criteria
### 6.1	Test Plan
#### 6.1.1	Test Plan Entry Criteria
Building a new version of the software will execute the testprocess.
#### 6.1.2	Test Plan Exit Criteria
When all tests pass without throwing an exception .
#### 6.1.3 Suspension and Resumption Criteria
It will be possible to skip the tests for faster deployment during development.
Apart from that the tests will always run till the end.

## 7.	Deliverables
### 7.1	Test Evaluation Summaries
Test evaluation will be available online on Github every time the tests are run by travis.
### 7.2	Reporting on Test Coverage
Test coverage numbers will be generated by travis. This is still to be done
### 7.3	Perceived Quality Reports
Code quality will be measured with codacy. This will be set up later.
### 7.4	Incident Logs and Change Requests
n/a
### 7.6	Additional Work Products
#### 7.6.1	Detailed Test Results
n/a
#### 7.6.2	Additional Automated Functional Test Scripts
n/a
#### 7.6.3	Test Guidelines
In general all testable code should be tested. We set a bound of 30% for coverage.
#### 7.6.4	Traceability Matrices
